# Recommended Deployment Topology

OpenLMIS uses and therefore recommends that most deployments utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS).  However OpenLMIS is in no way
tied to only being deployed on AWS.

The basic ingredients of an OpenLMIS deployment are:
* a domain name to reach the installation at (e.g. test.openlmis.org)
* a SSL certificate to make the communication to OpenLMIS secure over the web
* a computer/instance/etc that can run Docker Machine (as well as Compose, etc) with enough bandwidth, processing power, memory and
storage to run many (6+) Services and associated utilities
* a computer/instance/etc that can run PostgreSQL for those Services
* credentials with an SMTP server to send emails

In AWS (a region close to your users) this would be:
* A DNS provider for your domain name (e.g. test.openlmis.org).  This could be Route 53, however currently OpenLMIS deployments do
not utilize this service.
* A SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager
* A ELB that can route to/from the OpenLMIS instance and serve the ACM SSL certificate (this becomes more useful when running out
of Elastic IPs)
* an EC2 Instance (m4.large - 2vCPU, 8GiB memory, 30GB EBS store)
* an RDS Instance (db.t2 class instances are used below because most OpenLMIS
deployments have long periods of inactivity where the t2 class' credits are
able to accumulate.  Choose another class if your deployment will be
actively used for more than half the day):
  * For *local development*, *QA*, and *small private  demos*: use Ref Distro's
    included database or a **db.t2.micro** (though you'll need to increase the
    max_connections parameter to >150)
  * For *CD*, limited *public demos*, limited *UAT*: **db.t2.medium**
  * For *medium and larger deployments* as well as *production*: **db.t2.large** *or larger* based on need:
    * When reports are frequently run
    * When the number of Products (full and non-full supply) > 500
    * When the number of Requisitions (historical and planned for next 2
      processing periods) > 100,000
* a VPC for your EC2 and RDS instances, with appropriate security group - SSH, HTTP, HTTPs, Postgres (limit source to Security Group)
at minimum.
* Amazon SES with either the domain (w/DKIM) verified or a specific from-address

For more information on setting this up, see the 
[Provisioning](https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-deployment/blob/master/provision/Provision-single-host.md) section and also follow
the link for backing up/restoring 
[RDS](https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-deployment/blob/master/deployment/README.md#using-amazons-rds). For more information on how
to configure your RDS please visit
